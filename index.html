   <h2> Mirror Design Features</h2>

   <p> Local Weather and Location <br>
       Fitness Progress <br>
       National News <br>
       Calendar Events <br>
       Time and Date
   </p>
 
   <h2> Widget Implementation </h2>
   <p> Each design feature has the capability to be moved to any location of the mirror. With a simple click and drag of the mouse on the desired design feature, the user can customize the layout to their liking. With this simple widget, the amount of design variations is also optimized.   </p>

   <h2> Weather and Location Feature </h2>
   <p> The local weather and location feature gives the user a temperature of the city they are in, a simple description of the weather, and the city in which the user/mirror is located. This is implemented using an api which retrieves the weather details of the city in which the user/mirror is located.
   </p>

   <h2> Fitness Progress </h2>
   <p>
   The fitness feature shows the user's current weight, their weight last week, their goal weight, as well as the total amount of steps they have taken and the amount of time they have been standing that day. Additionally, the user is given the amount of time they worked out yesterday and the amount of time they exercised on that day last week.
   </p>

   <h2> National News </h2>
   <p>
   Small snippets of the national news scroll from right to left at the bottom of the mirror. As this feature is not as personal to the user, it is tucked towards the bottom to make the personalized features more prominent. With that being said, however, the widget implmentation allows the user to move the news to any location of the mirror if they would like for the news to be a more eminent feature.
   </p>

   <h2> Calendar Events </h2>
   <p>
   The user's personalized calendar is displayed for the user to see the events they have planned for today and in the coming future. This information is retrieved through a json file which holds the list of events on the calendar.
   </p>

   <h2> Time and Date </h2>
   <p>
   The time and date is displayed at the top of the screen so that the user can see what day it currently is, and what time it currently is.
   </p>

   <h2> Camera Implementatio     </h2>
   <p>
   Instead of using a static background, the camera of my computer is used as the background to simulate an actual mirror. 
   </p>

   <h2> Desired Mirror Size </h2>
   <p> Length: 35 inches <br> Width: 25 inches 
   </p>
